                        <p>Bulking is a phase in the bodybuilding cycle that involves consuming excess calories to build muscle. People tend to consume additional protein and carbohydrates in this phase.Afterward, a person tends to enter a cutting phase to burn the excess fat that builds up during a bulk.</p>

                    <h1>CUTTING</h1>
                    <div class="recipe-def">
                        <p>A cut is a period of eating at a calorie deficit as a means to lose body fat while maintaining as much muscle mass as possible. While resistance training continues to play a role during a cutting phase, you may not be able to lift weights with the same intensity as you can during a bulk.</p>

                    <h1>MAINTAIN</h1>
                    <div class="recipe-def">
                        <p>The idea of maintenance is to find a rhythm with your workouts that are not driven by maximum output - it's not about burning fat or gaining muscle. During a maintenance phase (which can last several weeks or several months) your goal should never be to max out reps or weight.</p>
